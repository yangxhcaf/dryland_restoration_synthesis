###A synthesis of dryland restoration techniques.  

![](./drylands.jpg)   

####Purpose
To quantitatively examine the efficacy of vegetation restoration in drylands globally.  

####Questions  
1. What is the global extent of research that directly examined restoration of drylands?  
2. What were the common measures?  
3. Is the restoration of vegetation a common and primary focus?  
4. How frequently does the restoration measure outcomes beyond the focal species?  
5. What were the primary restoration goals as reported by primary authors?  
6. How much variation was there in the techniques tested and how long were experiments monitored and tested?  
7. How relatively effective were the techniques?  

####Search  
```{r, studies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
studies <- read_csv("data/studies.csv")
studies

#quick look at rationale needed
exclusions <- studies %>%
  filter(exclude == "yes")

#quick look at studies with paradigms
evidence <- studies %>%
  filter(exclude == "no")

#library(skimr)
#skim(evidence)
```

###Study-level viz  
```{r, study viz, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#exclusions
ggplot(exclusions, aes(rationale)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "rational for exclusion", y = "frequency")

#evidence
ggplot(evidence, aes(paradigm)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip()

ggplot(evidence, aes(grazing)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip()
