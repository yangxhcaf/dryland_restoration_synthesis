###A synthesis of dryland restoration techniques.  

![](./drylands.jpg)   

###Purpose
To quantitatively examine the efficacy of vegetation restoration in drylands globally.  

###Questions  
1. What is the global extent of research that directly examined restoration of drylands?  
2. What were the common measures?  
3. Is the restoration of vegetation a common and primary focus?  
4. How frequently does the restoration measure outcomes beyond the focal species?  
5. What were the primary restoration goals as reported by primary authors?  
6. How much variation was there in the techniques tested and how long were experiments monitored and tested?  
7. How relatively effective were the techniques?  

###Step 1. search  
Study-level viz to document patterns in exclusions primarily and the relatie frequenices, at the study level, of major categories of evidence.  

```{r, studies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#study data####
library(tidyverse)
studies <- read_csv("data/studies.csv")
studies

#quick look at rationale needed
exclusions <- studies %>%
  filter(exclude == "yes")

#quick look at studies with paradigms
evidence <- studies %>%
  filter(exclude == "no")

#library(skimr)
#skim(evidence)

#study-level viz#####
#exclusions
ggplot(exclusions, aes(rationale, fill = region)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "rational for exclusion", y = "frequency") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired")

ggplot(evidence, aes(disturbance, fill = paradigm)) +
  geom_bar(na.rm = TRUE) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  labs(y = "frequency")

ggplot(evidence, aes(region, fill = paradigm)) +
  geom_bar(na.rm = TRUE) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  labs(y = "frequency")

ggplot(evidence, aes(data, fill = paradigm)) +
  geom_bar(na.rm = TRUE) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  labs(y = "frequency")

ggplot(evidence, aes(system, fill = paradigm)) +
  geom_bar(na.rm = TRUE) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  labs(y = "frequency")

ggplot(evidence, aes(goal, fill = paradigm)) +
  geom_bar(na.rm = TRUE) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  labs(x = "outcome", y = "frequency")

#step 1 models####
#paradigm
derived.evidence <- evidence %>%
  group_by(technique, data, region, disturbance, goal, paradigm) %>% summarise(n = n())

#active-passive split
m <- glm(n~paradigm, family = poisson, derived.evidence)
anova(m, test="Chisq")

#region
m1 <- glm(n~paradigm*region, family = poisson, derived.evidence)
#m1
#summary(m1)
anova(m1, test="Chisq")

#outcome
m2 <- glm(n~paradigm*goal, family = poisson, derived.evidence)
#m1
#summary(m1)
anova(m2, test="Chisq")

#even split between active and passive evidence by all key categories
```
